            <h2>How to Play Battleship</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="modal-body">
            <h2>Game Objective</h2>
            <ul>
                <li> The object of Battleship is to try and sink all of the other player's before they sink all of your ships. </li>
                <li> All of the other player's ships are somewhere on his/her board.</li>
                <li> You try and hit them by calling out the coordinates of one of the squares on the board. </li>
                <li> The other player also tries to hit your ships by calling out coordinates. </li>
            <li> Neither you nor the other player can see the other's board so you must try to guess where they are. </li>
            <li> Each board in the physical game has two grids:
                <ol> <li> The lower (horizontal) section for the player's ships </li>
                    <li> The upper part (vertical during play) for recording the player's guesses. </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Starting a New Game</h2>
            <ul>
                <li> Each player places the 3 ships somewhere on their board. The ships can only be placed vertically
                    or horizontally. Diagonal placement is not allowed. Use the buttons below the player board to place ships</li>
                <li> No part of a ship may hang off the edge of the board. Ships may not overlap each other. No ships may be placed on another ship.</li>
                <li> Once the guessing begins, the players may not move the ships. The 3 ships are: Battleship (4), Cruiser (3) and Destroyer (2).  </li>
                <li> Each ship will have a Captain's Quarters (CQ), the Destroyer and Battleship's Captain's Quarters will have armor. (Helm square)</li>
                <li> Use the buttons below the player board to place ships.  </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Playing the Game</h2>
            <ul>
                <li> Player's take turns guessing by calling out the coordinates. The opponent responds with "hit" or "miss" as appropriate. </li>
                <li> It takes two hits to destroy a Destroyer's or Battleship's Captain's Quarters and only one hit to destroy a Minesweeper's Captain's Quarters. </li>
                <li> When the Captain's Quarters is destroyed (Skull), the ship will sink. You should announce "hit and sunk".</li>
                <li> A new Sonar move can be used to reveal the opponent's occupied squares.</li>
                <li> The Sonar move will be available after a player has sunk one ship and can be used twice per game</li>
                <li> As soon as all of one player's ships have been sunk, the game ends.  </li>
                <li> To start attacking, click anywhere on the opponent's board.  </li>
            </ul>
